ASE230-Team-website
Overview

This project is a small PHP site that shows a team index and a detail page per member. It includes a shared helper module and wiring so:

Each member's age is calculated from a dob field and displayed on both the index and the detail pages.

The index page uses a function to render each member card from a member array and index.

The detail page uses a function to render each work-experience item.

These helpers centralize presentation logic and keep detail.php and index.php thin.

Files Changed / Added

helpers.php (NEW) — shared helper functions:

calculate_age($dob) — returns age in years (int) or null on invalid/missing DOB.

render_member_card(array $member, int $index) — outputs the HTML for one member card (used on index.php).

render_work_experience(array $job) — outputs one work experience item (used on detail.php).

index.php (MODIFIED)

Now includes helpers.php.

The in-file card markup was replaced by render_member_card($team[$i], $i) calls.

Sample DOBs were added for demo so ages show on load.

detail.php (MODIFIED)

Now includes helpers.php.

Displays age in the contact area if DOB exists (uses calculate_age).

The work-experience loop uses render_work_experience($job) for each item.

Shared functions remain in helpers.php instead of embedded in detail.php.

What the Helper Functions Do

calculate_age($dob)

Input: string date like YYYY-MM-DD

Output: integer years (e.g., 21) or null if invalid

Uses PHP DateTime and diff.

render_member_card(array $member, int $index)

Accepts the member data array and numeric index.

Produces the card markup used on index.php, filling in name, role, skills, summary, picture, and age.

Detail link uses detail.php?index={index}.

render_work_experience(array $job)

Accepts one work experience item (title, company, years, description).

Produces the timeline item markup used on detail.php.

Output sanitized with htmlspecialchars().

Demo DOBs

Sample DOB values were added so ages are visible (current date: Oct 2, 2025):

Alice Smith — 2004-09-15 → 21

Bob Johnson — 2005-03-22 → 20

Charlie Lee — 2006-05-30 → 19

If a DOB is missing, the age will not show.

How to Run Locally
Using XAMPP

Copy the project to htdocs (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs\ASE230-Team-website).

Start Apache from the XAMPP Control Panel.

Open in browser:

http://localhost/ASE230-Team-website/index.php

http://localhost/ASE230-Team-website/detail.php?index=0

Using PHP Built-in Server
php -S localhost:8000


Then open http://localhost:8000/index.php.

Quick Verification Checklist

✅ Visit index.php: each member card appears and shows age.

✅ Click a member card: detail.php shows age and work experience list.

✅ Run php -l helpers.php → no syntax errors.

✅ Browser console shows no layout issues.

Git Workflow (Simulated Team Collaboration)

To mimic a real team workflow, each feature was developed in its own branch and then merged into main.

Branches and Features

Branch: age-function

Added calculate_age($dob) in helpers.php.

Integrated into both index.php and detail.php.

Commit: Add calculateAge function

Branch: card-function

Added render_member_card($member, $index) in helpers.php.

Replaced hardcoded card HTML in index.php.

Commit: Add displayMemberCard function

Branch: work-function

Added render_work_experience($job) in helpers.php.

Updated detail.php to use it in the work loop.

Commit: Add displayWorkExperience function

Merge Process

age-function → merged into main

card-function → merged into main

work-function → merged into main

Each merge ensured the main branch contained all current features, simulating a team leader integrating contributions.
